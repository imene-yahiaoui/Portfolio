The project started with the analysis of mockups, provided in the form of Figma files for different screen sizes.\n Following the best practices of web development and adhering to established quality standards, I worked on integrating the mockups using HTML and CSS.\n I also ensured that the website was responsive, meaning that it automatically adapts to different screen types and sizes."
